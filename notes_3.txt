Inheritance
Polymorphism
- one thing having several forms
- Creating function with same name but each function performs different task
- Overriding is the example of polymorphism
- But overriding is only possible when there is inheritance


Overriding and Overloading
- Overloading is performed when we pass arguments
- Overriding means to update parent's method

- Overloading will have different arguments in parent and child function
- Overriding means to change logic, so it always done to show updated features

Super vs this

   scope - private, default, protected, public    
   private < default < protected < public

   Packages - Collection of similar classes
   Modularity
   com - commercial
   org - organization
   com.org.ProjectName.Module.SubModule

Overriding rules
- there are 3 rules, but right now we will understand only these 2...

1. Weaker Access Rule
   - we can't make override method to lower scope, means weaker access
   - If parent's method is default than we can't make child class method weaker (it means private)
   - If parent's method is weaker than we can make it strong by making it public


2. Covariant Return Type
